# 01. Container Fundamentals

In the previous file, we introduced the learning path for this repository.

Now we begin with the most important question:

1. What exactly is a container?
2. Before we talk about Docker commands, images, or registries, we must understand the core concept that changed modern infrastructure.

---

## 📦 What Is a Container?

A container is a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment that packages:

- Application code  
- Runtime  
- System libraries  
- Dependencies  
- Configuration  

All bundled together so the application runs consistently across different environments.

In simple terms:

A container ensures that an application behaves the same way everywhere.

---

## 🖥 The Problem Before Containers

Before containers, applications were typically deployed in one of these ways:

1. Directly on a physical server  
2. Inside virtual machines (VMs)

Each method had problems.

### Physical Server Deployment

- Dependency conflicts  
- Hard to isolate applications  
- Difficult to scale  
- Environment inconsistencies  

### Virtual Machines

Virtual machines improved isolation, but introduced:

- Heavy resource usage  
- Full guest operating system per VM  
- Slower startup times  
- Larger storage requirements  

Each VM contains:

- Guest OS  
- Application  
- Libraries  
- Hypervisor layer  

This makes VMs powerful but heavy.

---

## ⚙️ Containers vs Virtual Machines

Let’s compare clearly.

### Virtual Machine Architecture

- Hardware  
- Hypervisor  
- Guest OS  
- Application  

Each VM runs its own operating system.

### Container Architecture

- Hardware  
- Host OS  
- Container runtime  
- Containers  

All containers share the host operating system kernel.

This makes containers:

- Lightweight  
- Faster to start  
- More resource efficient  
- Easier to scale  

---

## 🧠 Why Containers Are Lightweight

Containers do not package a full operating system.

Instead, they share the host kernel and isolate applications using Linux features:

- Namespaces  
- Control Groups (cgroups)  

We will briefly explain these next.

---

## 🔒 Namespaces (Isolation)

Namespaces provide isolation.

They allow each container to have its own:

- Process tree  
- Network stack  
- File system view  
- Hostname  
- User IDs  

This means a process inside one container cannot see processes in another container.

It feels like its own mini system.

---

## 📊 cgroups (Resource Control)

Control Groups (cgroups) manage resource limits.

They allow you to restrict:

- CPU usage  
- Memory usage  
- Disk I/O  
- Network bandwidth  

For example, you can limit a container to:

- 512MB memory  
- 1 CPU core  

This prevents one application from consuming all system resources.

---

## 🧱 What Is a Container Image?

A container image is a read-only template used to create containers.

It contains:

- Application code  
- Runtime  
- Dependencies  
- Base OS layer  

An image is not running.

It becomes a container only when executed.

Think of it like this:

Image → Blueprint  
Container → Running instance of that blueprint

---

## 🧩 Image Layers (Conceptual Overview)

Container images are built in layers.

Each instruction in a build process creates a new layer.

Layers are:

- Immutable  
- Cached  
- Reusable  

This makes container builds efficient and fast.

We will explore this in detail in the Docker section.

---

## 📜 Open Container Initiative (OCI)

Containers follow open standards defined by the Open Container Initiative (OCI).

OCI defines:

- Image specification  
- Runtime specification  

This means containers are not limited to one tool.

Docker is one implementation.

Other container tools follow the same standards.

---

## 🚀 Why Containers Changed Modern Infrastructure

Containers enabled:

- Microservices architecture  
- Faster deployments  
- CI/CD automation  
- Cloud-native applications  
- Horizontal scaling  
- Immutable infrastructure  

They made applications portable across:

- Developer laptops  
- Testing environments  
- Production clusters  
- Cloud providers  

This portability is one of their biggest strengths.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- A container is an isolated application environment.  
- Containers share the host OS kernel.  
- Namespaces provide isolation.  
- cgroups provide resource control.  
- Images are blueprints; containers are running instances.  
- Containers follow open standards (OCI).  

Understanding these fundamentals is critical before learning Docker commands.

In the next section, we will answer:

How do containers actually run under the hood?
