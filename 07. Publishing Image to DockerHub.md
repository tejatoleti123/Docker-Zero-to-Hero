# 07. Publishing Image to DockerHub

In the previous section, we built our own custom Docker image.

Now we take the next important step:

Sharing that image with others using Docker Hub.

Docker Hub is a public container registry where you can:

- Store images
- Share images
- Version images
- Pull images from anywhere

---

# 🌍 What Is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to:

- Push your images
- Pull images from anywhere
- Manage repositories
- Control image versions

It works similarly to GitHub — but for container images.

---

# 🧑‍💻 Step 1: Create a Docker Hub Account

If you do not already have an account:

1. Go to: https://hub.docker.com/
2. Click Sign Up
3. Create a username
4. Verify your email

Your Docker Hub username will be used when tagging images.

Example:

    username/my-flask-app:v1

---

# 🔐 Step 2: Login to Docker Hub from Terminal

Run:

    docker login

You will be prompted for:

- Username
- Password

If successful, you will see:

    Login Succeeded

---

## 🔐 Recommended: Use Access Tokens (More Secure)

Instead of using your password:

1. Go to Docker Hub → Account Settings → Security
2. Generate an Access Token
3. Use the token as your password in `docker login`

This is safer for CI/CD and production environments.

---

# 🏷 Step 3: Tag Your Image Properly

Before pushing, your image must include your Docker Hub username.

If your image is:

    my-flask-app:v1

Tag it like this:

    docker tag my-flask-app:v1 <your-username>/my-flask-app:v1

Example:

    docker tag my-flask-app:v1 john123/my-flask-app:v1

Verify:

    docker images

You should now see:

    john123/my-flask-app    v1

---

# 🚀 Step 4: Push Image to Docker Hub

Run:

    docker push <your-username>/my-flask-app:v1

Example:

    docker push john123/my-flask-app:v1

Docker will:

1. Check authentication
2. Upload image layers
3. Skip layers already present
4. Confirm push success

You should see:

    latest: digest: sha256:...

This means the image was successfully uploaded.

---

# 🔎 Step 5: Verify on Docker Hub

1. Go to https://hub.docker.com/
2. Click Repositories
3. Open your repository

You should see:

- Image name
- Tag (v1)
- Image size
- Last updated timestamp

Your image is now publicly accessible.

---

# 🌎 Step 6: Pull Your Image from Anywhere

From any system with Docker installed:

    docker pull <your-username>/my-flask-app:v1

Then run:

    docker run -p 5000:5000 <your-username>/my-flask-app:v1

Your container works globally.

This demonstrates true portability.

---

# 🧠 Understanding Image Versioning

Avoid using:

    :latest

Instead use versioned tags:

    v1
    v1.0.0
    v1.1.2

Why?

- Clear version control
- Easier rollback
- Predictable deployments
- Better CI/CD workflows

In production environments, `latest` should not be used.

---

# 🔐 Public vs Private Repositories

Docker Hub allows:

- Public repositories (free, visible to everyone)
- Private repositories (restricted access)

For learning, public repositories are fine.

For production systems, private repositories are recommended.

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Docker Hub is a container registry.
- `docker login` authenticates your system.
- Images must be tagged with your username before pushing.
- `docker push` uploads images.
- Version tagging is important.
- Avoid using `latest` in production.

You have now completed the full container lifecycle:

Build → Tag → Push → Pull → Run

This is a major milestone.

## 🔜 Next Step

Now that we can run and share containers, we need to understand:

How do containers store data?
How do containers communicate with each other?

👉 [08. Docker Volumes & Networking](./08.%20Docker%20Volumes%20%26%20Networking.md)

In the next section, we will explore:

- Data persistence using volumes
- Bind mounts
- Container networking
- Port mapping
- Bridge networks
