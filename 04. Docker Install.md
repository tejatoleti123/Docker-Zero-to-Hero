# 04. Docker Install

In the previous section, we understood how Docker works internally — the client, daemon, containerd, and how containers are created under the hood.

Now it’s time to install Docker and verify that everything works correctly on your system.

This section will guide you step-by-step.

---

## 🖥 Supported Platforms

Docker can be installed on:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

The installation process differs slightly depending on your operating system.

---

## 📘 Official Docker Installation Guide (Recommended)

While this section provides a clear installation walkthrough, Docker installation steps may change over time.

For the most up-to-date and OS-specific instructions, always refer to the official Docker documentation:

🔗 Docker Official Installation Guide:

- Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
- macOS: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

If you are working in a production environment or specific Linux distribution, it is strongly recommended to follow the official documentation directly.

---

# 🐧 Install Docker on Linux

The recommended way to install Docker on Linux is through the official Docker repository.

The steps below are for Ubuntu (most common setup).

If you use a different distribution (CentOS, RHEL, etc.), refer to Docker’s official documentation for distribution-specific commands.

---

## Step 1: Update Package Index

    sudo apt update

---

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y

---

## Step 3: Add Docker’s Official GPG Key

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

---

## Step 4: Add Docker Repository

    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

---

## Step 5: Install Docker Engine

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y

---

## Step 6: Verify Installation

    sudo systemctl status docker

You should see:

    Active: active (running)

---

## Step 7: Run Docker Without sudo (Optional but Recommended)

By default, Docker requires sudo.

To allow your user to run Docker commands:

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Then log out and log back in.

Verify:

    docker --version

If it works without sudo, setup is complete.

---

# 🪟 Install Docker on Windows

On Windows, Docker is installed using Docker Desktop.

Steps:

1. Download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.
2. Install the application.
3. Enable WSL 2 (if prompted).
4. Restart your system if required.

Verify installation in PowerShell:

    docker --version

---

# 🍎 Install Docker on macOS

On macOS:

1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac.
2. Install the application.
3. Launch Docker Desktop.
4. Wait for Docker to start.

Verify:

    docker --version

---

# 🔍 Verify Docker Is Working Properly

Run the test container:

    docker run hello-world

What happens:

1. Docker checks if the image exists locally.
2. If not, it pulls from Docker Hub.
3. It creates a container.
4. The container prints a success message.

If you see a message saying:

    Hello from Docker!

Then your installation is successful.

---

# 🧠 Common Installation Issues

## Permission Denied

If you see:

    permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon

It means your user is not in the docker group.

Run:

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Then log out and log back in.

---

## Docker Daemon Not Running

If Docker is not running:

    sudo systemctl start docker

To enable Docker at boot:

    sudo systemctl enable docker

---

# 📦 Understanding What You Installed

When Docker is installed, you get:

- Docker CLI
- Docker Daemon (dockerd)
- containerd
- runc

These components work together to run containers.

This connects directly back to what we discussed in the previous sections.

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Docker installation differs by OS.
- On Linux, installation uses official Docker repositories.
- Docker Desktop is used on Windows and macOS.
- `docker run hello-world` verifies setup.
- Docker includes containerd and runc internally.

Now your system is ready to run containers.

---

## 🔜 Next Step

Now that Docker is installed and working, we will run our first real container.

In the next section, we will:

- Run containers
- Explore basic Docker commands
- Understand container lifecycle
- Inspect running containers
