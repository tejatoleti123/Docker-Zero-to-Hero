# Docker Zero to Hero 🚀

Welcome.

This repository is a structured, step-by-step learning path designed to take you from understanding what containers are to building optimized, production-ready Docker images.

It is written for:

- Beginners who want clarity instead of memorizing commands  
- Intermediate learners who want to understand how Docker really works  
- Cloud, DevOps, and SRE professionals strengthening their container fundamentals  
- Engineers preparing for interviews  
- Anyone who wants to understand containers properly — not superficially  

This is not just a command reference.  
It is a guided journey.

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

Many Docker tutorials jump straight into:

    docker run
    docker build
    docker push

Without answering:

- What is a container really?  
- How does it differ from a virtual machine?  
- What is a container runtime?  
- How does Docker fit into the container ecosystem?  
- What happens internally when you run a container?  
- Why are image layers important?  
- How do production teams optimize images?  

This repository fixes that.

We start with foundational concepts, then move step-by-step into practical implementation, and finally into production best practices.

- Container runtime ecosystem (runc, containerd, OCI)  
- Docker architecture and components  
- Installing Docker correctly  
- Running and managing containers  
- Writing Dockerfiles from scratch  
- Building and tagging images properly  
- Publishing images to DockerHub  
- Working with volumes and networking  
- Multi-stage builds

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows three principles:

### 1️⃣ Understand before memorizing  
You should know why something works — not just how to type it.

### 2️⃣ Concept before tool  
We explain containers before Docker.

### 3️⃣ Production mindset  
Even beginner topics are explained with real-world engineering context.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Basic Linux command-line familiarity  
- Git installed  
- A system where Docker can be installed (Linux / Windows / macOS)  

No prior Docker knowledge is required.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Start with **Container Fundamentals**.  
2. Move sequentially.  
3. Run commands yourself.  
4. Build the example images.  
5. Publish to DockerHub.  
6. Experiment beyond the examples.  

Do not skip the early files.  
They are foundational.

## 🔐 Production-Oriented Notes

Throughout this repository, we emphasize:

- Avoiding the `latest` tag in production  
- Using minimal base images  
- Running containers as non-root users  
- Reducing attack surface  
- Optimizing image size  
- Clear tagging strategy  

---

## 📈 What Comes After This?

After completing this repository, you will be ready to:

- Learn Kubernetes  
- Understand container orchestration  
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with Docker  
- Use Docker in production environments
