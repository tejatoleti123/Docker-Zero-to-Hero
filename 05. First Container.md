# 05. First Container

In the previous section, we installed Docker and verified that it is running correctly.

Now it’s time to run your first real container and understand how containers behave in practice.

This is where concepts start becoming real.

---

# 🚀 Running Your First Container

Let’s start with a simple example.

Run:

    docker run hello-world

---

## 🔍 What Just Happened?

When you ran that command, Docker performed several steps automatically:

1. Checked if the `hello-world` image exists locally  
2. If not, pulled it from Docker Hub  
3. Created a container from the image  
4. Executed the container’s default command  
5. Printed output  
6. Stopped the container  

This entire flow demonstrates the container lifecycle.

---

# 📦 Understanding `docker run`

The basic syntax:

    docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND]

Example:

    docker run nginx

This command:

- Pulls the nginx image (if not available locally)
- Creates a container
- Starts it

---

# 🔄 Interactive Containers

Let’s run a container interactively.

Run:

    docker run -it ubuntu bash

Explanation:

- `-i` → Interactive mode  
- `-t` → Allocate terminal  
- `ubuntu` → Image  
- `bash` → Command to execute  

Now you are inside the container.

Try:

    ls
    whoami
    uname -a

You are operating inside an isolated environment.

To exit:

    exit

When you exit, the container stops.

---

# 📊 Viewing Running Containers

To see running containers:

    docker ps

To see all containers (including stopped ones):

    docker ps -a

You will notice that containers have:

- Container ID  
- Image name  
- Status  
- Ports  
- Names  

---

# 🛑 Stopping a Container

If a container is running in the background, stop it using:

    docker stop <container_id>

Example:

    docker stop abc123

---

# 🗑 Removing a Container

To remove a stopped container:

    docker rm <container_id>

You cannot remove a running container.

It must be stopped first.

---

# 🏷 Running in Detached Mode

To run a container in the background:

    docker run -d nginx

The `-d` flag means detached mode.

To see it:

    docker ps

To stop it:

    docker stop <container_id>

---

# 🧪 Practical Example: Create and Run Your Own Simple Container

Let’s create a very small custom container example.

We will:

1. Create a simple HTML file  
2. Use the official Nginx image  
3. Mount our HTML file into the container  
4. Access it from the browser  

---

## Step 1: Create a Simple HTML File

Create a file called:

    index.html

Add the following content:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Container</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello from my custom container!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>

---

## Step 2: Run Nginx with a Bind Mount

Run:

    docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
      -v $(pwd)/index.html:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html \
      nginx

Explanation:

- `-d` → Run in background  
- `-p 8080:80` → Map host port 8080 to container port 80  
- `-v` → Mount local file into container  
- `nginx` → Base image  

---

## Step 3: Access Your Container

Open your browser:

    http://localhost:8080

You should see:

    Hello from my custom container!

You just customized a container without building a new image.

---

## 🔎 What Did We Learn?

- Containers can use existing images.
- You can modify container behavior using bind mounts.
- Containers are flexible and configurable at runtime.
- Port mapping allows external access.

This example shows how powerful containers are even before building custom images.

In the next section, we will build our own image using a Dockerfile instead of modifying containers at runtime.

---

# 🌐 Exposing Ports

By default, containers are isolated.

To access a web server container:

    docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

Explanation:

- `8080` → Host port  
- `80` → Container port  

Now open:

    http://localhost:8080

You should see the Nginx welcome page.

---

# 📜 Viewing Container Logs

To view logs from a running container:

    docker logs <container_id>

To follow logs in real time:

    docker logs -f <container_id>

---

# 🔎 Inspecting a Container

To see detailed information:

    docker inspect <container_id>

This shows:

- Network settings  
- Mounts  
- Environment variables  
- Runtime configuration  

---

# 🧠 Container Lifecycle Summary

Container lifecycle stages:

1. Created  
2. Running  
3. Stopped  
4. Removed  

Containers are ephemeral by default.

If removed, their filesystem changes are lost.

This is why volumes exist — which we will cover later.

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- `docker run` creates and starts containers.
- Containers are isolated processes.
- `-it` allows interactive use.
- `-d` runs containers in the background.
- `docker ps` lists containers.
- Containers stop when their main process exits.
- Containers are temporary unless configured otherwise.

You now understand how to run and manage containers.

---

# 🔜 Next Step

Now that you can run containers, the next logical step is:

How do we build our own container images?

👉 [06. Building Custom Image](./06.%20Building%20Custom%20Image.md)

In the next section, we will:

- Write our first Dockerfile  
- Build a custom image  
- Understand image layers  
- Tag images properly
